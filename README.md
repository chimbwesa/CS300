    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      I was tasked with understanding data structures well enough to implement and manipulate them. This inlcuded
      the ability to accurately annalyze the data streuctures time complexities and know the stenghts of each and 
      knowing which data structure is optimal to accomplish a certain task. Additionally i had to read and 
      process data from external cvs files.
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      Data structures are important to understrand becasue they can effect the systems performance. 
      This includes the effeciency, scalabilitry, and organization of data. I had to consider the 
      aspects of data manipulation such as searching, inserting, and deleting in order to decide which
      data structure provides the best solition to the problem. 
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      It was important to fully understand each data structure. Any minor misunderstanding resulted in 
      a faulty implementaion of the data structure. Researching and adding code that served the 
      purpose of testing and debugging helped overcome roadblocks. 
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      Working on this project provided insight and experience understanding the problem, chossing the right 
      tools and techniques. It helped in understanding performance considerations, strenghened problem solving
      by thinking about modular programming. The algorithms needed to implement data structures helped further
      my understanding of step by step logica thinking. 
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      The scale of the project made it essential to write clean, simple, and reusable code. This helped reduce bugs,
      program faster, and maintain the code effeciently and optimally.
